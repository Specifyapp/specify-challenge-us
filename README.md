# Challenge us by Specify

### What is it?
Specify has been in the Design System space for a couple of years now and we know how hard it is for Designers and Front End Devs to work together in the most efficient way possible. What we see on a daily basis is that teams are struggling to automate and streamline their design-to-code workflow. Mostly because they think that tools cannot generate the output they are hoping for, so they need to perform a lot of manual actions over and over again. Well, that’s exactly why we are here. The Specify Design Token Engine, based upon our Design Token Format released in 2023, is able to generate any output you are hoping to get. And we would like you to challenge us on this claim. 

### Who should participate?
If you are performing many manual actions, or not sure if your workflow between design and code is the most efficient one, start uploading your file. We can help.   It doesn’t matter whether you are a (UX/UI)designer, (front end) developer, or design (system) engineer. As long as you are focused on optimising your design system and you are working with design tokens. 

### How to participate?

Gather your team and fill [a new issue](https://github.com/Specifyapp/specify-challenge-us/issues/).
We will update statuses on the issues regularly. Every 2 weeks we will share the output and a video of how to produce it.
